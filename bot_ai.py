HELP_MESSAGE = """
I understand the following commands:

/joke - dont take chitti jokes seriously! 
/radio - only good radio
/wiki - wikipedia 

/echo - Say something.
E.G. if you type "/echo hello", I will say "hello".

/calculate, /calc, /eval or /python - Calculate some calculations, or evaluate python 3 code. \
(These commands are synonyms.)
E.G. if you type "/calculate 1 + 2", I will say "3".

/bot - Talk to me. Useful only when talking to me in a group.
E.G. if you type "/bot hello", I will answer the same thing as I would if you typed just "hello".

/help - Show this message.

Instead of commanding me, we can just chat! Try asking "What is your name?"
